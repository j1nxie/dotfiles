  #
  # Usage:
  #   1. For games/launchers which integrate GameMode support:
  #      https://github.com/FeralInteractive/GameMode#apps-with-gamemode-integration
  #      simply running the game will automatically activate GameMode.
  #   2. For others, launching the game through gamemoderun: `gamemoderun ./game`
  #   3. For steam: `gamemoderun steam-runtime`
